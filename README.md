# IMDBScripts
This was a project that required me to create scripts in python that interacted with a subset of the IMDB database. The two scripts are "msearch" and "toprank" 

## ./msearch examples

msearch's usage is : ./msearch "substring1" "substring2" "substring3" ....

Below is an example of msearch executing on a single user input

Here is an example of msearch executing on multiple user inputs, where results have to have all three strings in either their actors list, director/s or movie title.

## ./toprank examples
toprank's usage is : ./toprank "[optional genre]&[optional genre]" [minimum rating]
Below is an example of toprank executing on when there is a single genre being searched and a minimum rating.
